                    Likely: "Academy of Sciences", "Resettlements", "Young Pioneers", "Hero of the People"

                    The idea: The primary 3 policies are Party Leadership, Five-Year Plan, and Worker's Faculities. The idea is
                    that Order primarily benefits you the more cities you have, while having mediocre benefits. On the other hand,
                    Worker's Faculities and Five-Year Plan explictly is deisgned to make science victory as easy as possible without 
                    relying on great people. Communism also hammers this idea home with even more science to cross the finish line

                    2 main questions arise trying to squeeze Order down to a traditional tree:
                    1. How do you handle the happiness policies, especially in comparison to Freedom. In BNw, the happiness per specialist policy
                        is 6 happiness per city. In G&K, that would jump to 8. The current formula seems to just be add more happiness policies.
                        But that leads to the second point
                    2. Which policies do you choose? In Lekmod discussions, the discussion often is that there's a ton of choices in Order to be
                    worth your time while Freedom only really wants to get their level 3 policy and then get anything else. There is definitely
                    options to choose from and reasons to choose them. If you don't argue all in on the happiness policies, People's Army is a worthwhile
                    consideration, Patriotic War gives Order some combat ability, Resettlements help settle new cities late, and Hero of the People
                    let's you get at least some great people easier late game

                    Comparision to Deciv Collectivism: Of the three, this is the closest to matching up. Collectivism is made to be a production focused tree,
                    as a sort of opposite of Monopoly. This works suprisingly well due to the sheer amount of production gives. Still, it's not perfect.
                    The most obvious problem is just that Order as is, with very little changes, is incredibly strong, even if you don't give it the happiness
                    that Freedom or Autocracy can get. It also has a weird name for what it actually amounts to imo, as many of the effects are focused around
                    stuff like mines or factories

                    Freedom's main effects are from their 3 specialist policies. This sends a very clear message:
                    Freedom is all about rewarding you mfor working specialists and generating great people. While
                    people claim that Freedom is particular good at culture victory, it doesn't necessarily care about
                    it. It just wgets there with more Artists, the culture from working artist specialists in the first place,
                    and from great works in more Brave New World based mods.

                    A hidden side effect of this is that while Order gives a few benefits that help out when having
                    a large amount of cities, Freedom's focus on specialists is far more helpful for going tall.
                    Specialist stats usual are worse than tile stats, particularly late in a game, unless you go with
                    Freedom, and even when Freedom makes specialist equal to tile stats, the extra food given still
                    heavily promotes the high population cities needed for playing tall, unlike Order. On the other hand
                    The production Freedom gives definitely doesn't compare nearly as well in an area full of mines

                    From this perspective, Freedom's branch mostly builds itself. Universal Suffrage, Treaty Organization,
                    and Civil Society are core to the tree. Avant Garde increases the speed that your specialists create
                    great people. And New Deal increases the stats of the great improvements from said great people.
                    From here, you're only really missing 2 policy effects. Here, you have a few options
                    1. If you add in all of the happiness effects from Order, you might as well race them with
                    Capitalism. This makes both policy give a ton happiness, however, so it's worth being careful about
                    2. Free Mind and Creative Expression are especially fitting if you balance this for a BNW style mod
                    They lean a bit hard on the angle of culture victory, but they do both give you even more reason to work
                    culture specialists. Media Culture also fits in this idea (assuming it gave toursim as expected, not culture),
                    but it doesn't really fit as directly into the gimmick around specialists. Likelise, a large part of this
                    idea falls apart in G&K, where increasing Artist generation is oddly specific alongside Avant Garde
                    and Great Works don't exists as a direct consquecence of generating great people
                    3. Volunteer Army provides Freedom with some way to defend itself. So does the city defense policy in the regular
                    G&K ruleset. However, they are a bit off the intended idea
                    4. Urbanization and Economic Union is an intentional addition to give Freedom some flexiblity and are also
                    extremely important Freedom policies. However, they do benefit a bit too much for playing wide, when Freedom's
                    gimmick is far more suited for playing tall

                    Comparison to Deciv Constitution: There seems to be a loss in communication somewhere along the line.
                    As stated, Freedom doesn't necessarily care about culture victory, it's just easier at acomplishing it,
                    particularly in BNW. That't kinda the least of the problems, though. The bigger issue is there seems to be a loss
                    of what to do with the tree besides just the specialist benefits. For instance, there's a strangely high amount
                    of food growth in the tree despite being supposedly culture/specialist focused. There's a whole policy that
                    gives gold and reduces the maintentence of roads. It seems to lean even harder on growing cities than Freedom already
                    does, which makes the tree even stronger than it could've been otherwise (and it would've already been base level
                    extremely strong). The idea of what to do seems to just be lost in translation. There's a reason many of the Deciv
                    rebalances just drop the Freedom aspects from Constitution and instead play the culture tree idea straight

                    In Lekmod, Autocracy is known for one thing and one thing only: Comabat bonuses. While the other
                    Ideology tree have a good amount of stats with very little combat benefit, Autocracy is the exact opposite:
                    combat bonuses with very little stats. Part of the idea is to at least allow the other trees a way to fight
                    back, even if they don't have the raw strength of Autocracy

                    This brings some interesting questions of which policies to make a tree out of Autocracy. While
                    Clausewitz's Legacy and Elite Forces are a given, and Fascism is a necessity to match Freedom's happiness, everything else
                    is up to the person implementing it. Do you add in Total War, and Mobilization to make it easier to amass a massive army?
                    Do you double down on Honor's benefits with Iron Fist and Police State, given both branches are combat focused?
                    Do you add in Third Alternative to remove resources as a barrier to war? What about Nationism and Lightning
                    Warfare to make the benefits to combat even more noteworthy? The other trees also had questions regarding the number
                    of happiness policies you add, so why not discuss the same question with Militarism

                    Comparison to Supremacy: At face value, there is a comparison. Total Wat and Clausewitz's Legacy is here,
                    (though not the more important Eltle Forces), there's some benefits to captured cities, I guess. In practice, though,
                    this branch seems far more focused on fighting cities. This almost makes sense. Sovereignty, the replacement for Honor,
                    is also focused on combat and so it makes sense to try to differenciate them. But that just means you're doubleing on effects.
                    And as a reminder: part of the reason Autocracy doesn't have too many production or food is explictly to make it easier to fight.
                    Having both Honor and Autocracy be available to choosen alongside a production heavy branch like Order just makes things especially
                    dangerous and removes pretty much all other options. Again, Supremacy tries to limit this by limiting its
                    effects to just vs cities, but now the policy tree is kinda weak in all other circumstances and is even less like where
                    it started. There's a reason I commented out Supremacy and have been moving some of its effects to Bionics it seems
                    like a mess to actually balance correctly
